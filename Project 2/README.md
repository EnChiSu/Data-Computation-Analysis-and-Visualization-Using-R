## Description
In the project, I generate random numbers from multivariate normal in 80x80 grid. Four situations I simulate, which are range=1, range=2, range=3, and range=6. Number of range represents the distance that every row condition on. For example, in the case of range=2, every row condition on the row above. In the case of range=3, every row condition on two rows above. <br/>
 <br/>
Our final goal is to generate simulation and figures as below: <br/>
