## DATA COMPUTATION, ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION USING R
These are the projects I've done in the "Data Computation, Analysis and Visualization Using R" in the first semester of 2019 at the National Taiwan University. <br/>
 <br/>
In the class, we focus heavily on the visualization of data simulation and computation. The visualization results help us understand several statistics theories, computation methods and visulization tools in R. For more our class materials and projects, you can find it [here](http://www.rslabntu.net/courses/data_computation_analysis_and_visualization_using_r).<br/>

If there is any suggestion you would like to give, please don't hesitate to contact me through my email r07741074@ntu.edu.tw. Thank you.
