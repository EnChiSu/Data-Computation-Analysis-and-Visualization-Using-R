## DATA COMPUTATION, ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION USING R
These are the projects I've done in the "Data-Computation-and-Visualization-Using-R" in the second semester of 2019 at the National Taiwan University. <br/>
 <br/>
In the class, we focus heavily on the visualization of data simulation. The visualization results help us understand several theoretical statistics computation method and visulization tools in R. Some of the class marterials can also be found in http://www.rslabntu.net/courses/data_computation_analysis_and_visualization_using_r.<br/>

If there is any suggestion you would like to give, please don't hesitate to contact me through my email r07741074@ntu.edu.tw. Thank you.
