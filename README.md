These are the projects I've done in the "Data-Computation-and-Visualization-Using-R" in the second semester of 2019 at the National Taiwan University. <br\>

In the class, we focus heavily on the visualization of data simulation. The visualization results help us understand several theoretical statistics computation method and visulization tools in R.
